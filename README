This directory contains development efforts for a new and
improved perldl shell (Perldl2) that can integrate with
the Padre IDE to support PDL development.

You need to install the version 1.003010 of Devel::REPL
in order to build/use the Perldl2 shell. A description
of the files in this directory and how to install and
use the Perldl2 shell follows.

 README
   This file.

 pdl2
   This is a perl script for starting the Perldl2 shell.


+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|                      INSTALLATION                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

  Install Devel::REPL version 1.003010 or greater.

  Then configure and build PDL as usual.  The presence
  of Devel::REPL should be detected and the Perldl2
  support built and installed.
 

+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|                           USE                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+

  To use the Perldl2 shell, from the PDL build directory
  run the following:

    perl -Mblib Perldl2/pdl2

  If you have installed the just built PDL, you should
  be able to run:

    pdl2

 To exit the Perldl2 shell from the PDL> prompt, type Ctrl-D
 or quit.

 WARNING: Typing exit will also quit the shell but do so by
 terminating the perl interpreter. Probably not what you
 want to do---especially if you want to keep command history.

 Supported functionality from Devel::REPL and PDL:
  * Commands (generic command creation)
  * DDS (pretty prints output using Data::Dump::Streamer)
  * History (redo commands with !-1 and !<num> syntax)
  * Interrupt (interrupt with Ctrl-C; not on MSWin32)
  * LexEnv (e.g., my $a = zeros(10) works)
  * MultiLine::PPI (handles multiline input like perldl)
  * NiceSlice (PDL::NiceSlice works too!)
  * Packages (keeps track of current user package)
  * ReadLineHistory
    * Save and restore command history to file
    * NOTE: defaults to ~/.perlreplhist
  * CompletionDrivers
    * Globals  (completion for globals) 
    * INC      (completion for use module::name)
    * Keywords (completion for perl keywords)
    * LexEnv   (completion for lexical vars)
    * Methods  (completion of method names)

 Default PDL modules loaded:
  * PDL
  * PDL::Dbg
  * PDL::Doc::Perldl
  * PDL::IO::Dumper
  * PDL::IO::FlexRaw
  * PDL::IO::Pic
  * PDL::Image2D
  * PDL::AutoLoader

 help, apropos work but
 * ? and ?? aliases don't work (use help or apropos words)
 * you need to quote the arguments (e.g.,  help 'sumover')

 p is an alias for print.

 The Perldl2 shell, pdl2, now loads/saves from the same
 history file as perldl.  This is a new feature so, as
 always, feedback welcome.
 The Perldl2 shell should be able to load/save a history file
 from perldl 1.x (i.e., $HOME/.perldl_hist) if you copy it to a file of the correct name.
 Let me know how that works for you (UNTESTED).

 Edit the Perldl2.pm file to add additional default setup
 for the perldl2 shell.  You can $repl->eval() anything
 you want before the shell starts.  The other thing is
 to $repl->load_plugin() if you wish to try additional
 Devel::REPL plugins.
